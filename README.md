# Kinematics and Dynamics of Mechanical System
Kinematics is the study of motion without considering forces. In a kinematic analysis, positions, displacements, velocities and accelerations are calculated for
mechanical system components without regard to the loads that actually govern them. In comparison to other engineering design studies such as statics, where motion and
governing loads are considered according to Newton’s first law, and dynamics, where motion and governing loads are considered according to Newton’s second law, kinematics is the most fundamental engineering design study. It is often necessary in the design of a mechanical system to 
not only consider the motion of its components, but also the following:
• Static or dynamic loads acting on the components (considered in statics and dynamics)
• Component material stress and strain responses to the loads (considered in stress analysis)
• Required component dimensions for the working stresses (considered in machine design)
